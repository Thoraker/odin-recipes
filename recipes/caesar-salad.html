    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set 2 shelves near
          the center of the oven. Spray a baking pan with cooking spray; place
          frozen chicken filets on the pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven on the lower-center shelf until hot and
          crisp, about 20 minutes, turning filets over halfway through heating
          time. When cool enough to handle, cut filets into bite-sized pieces.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, and
          add tater tots in an even layer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Bake on upper-center shelf in the preheated oven until tots are soft
          and slightly baked, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Spray cooking
          spray on the bottom of a cup. Smash each tater tot into a flat disk
          with cup.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Return to the oven; bake until golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20
          minutes. Remove from oven again, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan
          cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
          Bake again until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool,
          about 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, whisk Caesar dressing, lemon juice, anchovy paste, garlic,
          1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>
          Toss together lettuce, chicken, remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and
          remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper until well combined. Pour half the
          dressing into salad mix and toss until evenly coated. Add cooled tater
          tots and toss until well combined.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <p>
          Transfer to a serving platter, drizzle with white balsamic vinegar,
          and garnish with more Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
