        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
          tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>
          To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>
          Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <p>Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.</p></li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 10</h3>
        <p>
          Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
          Parmesan cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 11</h3>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 12</h3>
        <p>
          Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
          spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 13</h3>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
          for an additional 25 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 14</h3>
